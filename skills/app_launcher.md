To open an app, simply say the app name you want to launch (e.g., 'open Chrome'). The skill will automatically execute the command to open it on your desktop. Example command: `open_app({"app_name":"APP_NAME"})` where APP_NAME is the name of the application you want to launch. Also, you can add more app-specific commands as needed.
